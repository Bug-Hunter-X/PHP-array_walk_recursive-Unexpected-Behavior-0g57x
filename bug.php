This code uses a non-standard function `array_walk_recursive` with a custom callback function `my_callback`.  The issue lies in how the callback function attempts to modify the array elements.  PHP's `array_walk_recursive` passes the value by reference, allowing the callback to modify the original array. However, the attempt to modify the array element with `$value = $value + 1;` is incorrect.  While it *appears* to modify the value within the callback, it only affects the `$value` variable locally within the scope of the callback.  The original array remains unchanged.
